## 📘 Example Project: SMS Spam Classification
This notebook demonstrates a complete NLP workflow for classifying SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.

### 🔹 Steps Covered
- Load SMS spam dataset  
- Convert labels (ham/spam) into numerical format  
- Split dataset into train/test sets  
- Convert text into numeric vectors using **TF-IDF**  
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier  
- Evaluate model using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Classification report  
  - Confusion matrix  
- Visualize results using Seaborn  

### 🔹 Why this project?
